# Library App

**Live Demo:**  https://codebymihaly.github.io/Library/

## Overview

This project is part of **The Odin Project** curriculum and focuses on building a simple library application using JavaScript objects and constructor functions.  
The goal was to practice object creation, DOM manipulation, and user interaction through forms.

Users can:
- Add new books  
- Mark books as read or unread  
- Remove books from the library  

All data is stored in memory, making this a pure front‑end JavaScript project.

## Features

- Add books through a modal form  
- Toggle read/unread status  
- Remove books from the list  
- Dynamic DOM rendering  
- Clean and minimal UI  

## What I used

- JavaScript  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  

## What I Learned

- Working with objects and constructor functions  
- Managing dynamic UI updates  
- Handling user input and form validation  
- Structuring small JavaScript applications  
- Improving DOM manipulation skills
